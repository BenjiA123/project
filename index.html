     <div class="cards">
      <div class="card">A brain tumor refers to an abnormal growth of cells within the brain. These tumors can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) and can originate from different cell types within the brain.</div>
      <div class="card">As the tumor grows, it can exert pressure on surrounding brain tissues, leading to a range of symptoms such as headaches, seizures, difficulty with speech or movement, and changes in cognitive abilities.</div>
      <div class="card">Early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors are crucial for timely medical interventions and improved treatment outcomes. Our brain tumor detection application can assist in the early identification of potential tumors, aiding in prompt medical attention and patient care.</div>

      <h2>Convolutional Neural Networks And Brain Tumor Detection</h2>

          <p>
            Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models commonly used for image analysis tasks, including brain tumor detection in MRI scans. They are designed to automatically learn and extract relevant features from input images through a series of convolutional layers.
          </p>
        </div>

            <h1>2</h1> <br>
            <p>
              In the context of brain tumor detection in MRI scans, CNNs operate by first taking in an input MRI image and passing it through several convolutional layers. Each convolutional layer consists of multiple filters that slide across the image, performing element-wise multiplications and summations to extract local features. These filters capture patterns and structures at different scales, such as edges, textures, or shapes.
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h1>3</h1><br>
            <p>
               As the image passes through the convolutional layers, the network progressively learns higher-level features by combining and abstracting the low-level features. This hierarchical feature extraction allows the CNN to capture complex patterns specific to brain tumors.
            </p>
          </div>
          
         <div>
          <h1>4</h1><br>
          <p>
              After the convolutional layers, the extracted features are flattened and passed through fully connected layers. These layers act as classifiers, making predictions based on the learned features. The final output represents the probability of the input image containing a brain tumor or belonging to different tumor classes (e.g., benign or malignant).
          </p>
         </div>

            <h1>5</h1><br>
            <p>
               To train a CNN for brain tumor detection, a large dataset of labeled MRI scans is required. The network is trained using a process called backpropagation, where the model adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual tumor labels. This optimization process enables the CNN to improve its performance in detecting brain tumors over time.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
              Once trained, the CNN can be used for the automatic analysis of new MRI scans. By feeding unseen scans into the network, it can provide predictions about the presence and characteristics of brain tumors, aiding radiologists and healthcare professionals in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.
